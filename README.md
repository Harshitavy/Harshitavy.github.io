# Personal Portfolio Website


As a self-learning web development project, I created and hosted a personal portfolio website on GitHub.
This project showcases my skills and projects, featuring responsive design, interactive elements, and smooth navigation.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bootstrap and demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development and version control with GitHub.
